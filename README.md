# My configuration files

**Warning**: this repository is for now quite dirty. I committed my files as-is,
and some static data (such as usernames, GPG public key ID…) may still exist. I
do **not** guarantee anything.

If you’re still reading this, and have understood that you shouldn’t use as-is
those files, you could find useful my configurations for the following softs:

- awesome WM manager
- urxvt (Solarized theme) with Powerline fonts
- zsh (with [oh-my-zsh])
- vim (for a developper usage)
- [mutt + offlineimap + msmtp + mu](http://dev.gentoo.org/~tomka/mail.html)
- XCompose
